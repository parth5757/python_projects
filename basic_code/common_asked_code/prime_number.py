# Prime number means that number is only divided by that own number or 1
'''
For example:

The number 2 is a prime number because its only divisors are 1 and 2.
The number 3 is a prime number because its only divisors are 1 and 3.
The number 4 is not a prime number because it can be divided by 1, 2, and 4 (4 = 2 Ã— 2).
The number 5 is a prime number because its only divisors are 1 and 5.
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and so on.
